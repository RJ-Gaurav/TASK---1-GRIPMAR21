--- DATASET ---
It consisted of attributes like weapon type used, no. of attack, countries that were attacked, no. of kills, yearly data of attacks on each region, etc.

--- Key Findings ---
Conclusion & Analyzed Information

What I found:
From the first visualization I found that, by 2020 'Hostage Taking' and 'Bombing/Explosion' was at its peak for the attack type used in most of the regions.
From the second visualization I could see that, 'Number of attacks' was the highest in the year '2014'.
From the third visualization it's clear that, country that is most affected from terrorism is 'Iraq'.
From the fourth visualization it could be said that, 'Explosives' were the most popular weapon among the terrorist groups for carrying out the attacks.

Finally, I completed the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the Global Terrorism Dataset provided and the above mentioned points are my key findings for this particular dataset.
